Aim of the analysis</a>
</h2>

<p>
The Boston Housing data set was analyzed by&nbsp;<a href="http://sfb649.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/fedc_homepage/xplore/tutorials/mvahtmlnode148.html#har:rub:78">Harrison and Rubinfeld (1978)</a> who
wanted to find out whether ``clean air'' had an influence on house prices.
We will use this data set in this chapter and in 
most of the following chapters to 
illustrate the presented methodology. The data are described in 
Appendix&nbsp;<a href="http://sfb649.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/fedc_homepage/xplore/tutorials/mvahtmlnode128.html#tabhousing">B.1</a>.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00382000000000000000">
What can be seen from the PCPs</a>
</h2>

<p>
In order to highlight the relations of <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$"> to the remaining 13 variables
we color all of the observations with <img width="52" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg205.gif" alt="$X_{14}&gt;$">median<img width="47" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg206.gif" alt="$(X_{14})$"> as red lines
in Figure&nbsp;<a href="http://sfb649.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/fedc_homepage/xplore/tutorials/mvahtmlnode11.html#c1bhpcpfig">1.24</a>.
Some of the variables seem to be strongly related. 
The most obvious relation is the negative dependence 
between <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg207.gif" alt="$X_{13}$"> and <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$">. 
It can also be argued that there exists a strong dependence 
between <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg208.gif" alt="$X_{12}$"> and <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$"> since no red lines are drawn 
in the lower part of <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg208.gif" alt="$X_{12}$">. 
The opposite can be said about <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg209.gif" alt="$X_{11}$">: there are only red lines
plotted in the lower part of this variable. 
Low values of <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg209.gif" alt="$X_{11}$"> induce high values of <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$">. 

</p><p>
For the PCP, the variables have been rescaled over the interval <img width="39" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg210.gif" alt="$[0,1]$">
for better graphical representations. 
The PCP shows that the variables are not distributed in a symmetric manner. 
It can be clearly seen that the values of  
<img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg14.gif" alt="$X_1$"> and <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg211.gif" alt="$X_9$"> are much more concentrated around 0. Therefore it makes
sense to consider transformations of the original data.

The scatterplot matrix</a>
</h2>

<p>
One characteristic of the  PCPs is that many 
lines are drawn on top of each other. 
This problem is reduced by depicting the variables
in pairs of scatterplots. Including all 14 variables 
in one large scatterplot matrix 
is possible, but makes it hard to see anything from the plots. 
Therefore, for illustratory purposes we will analyze only one such matrix
from a subset of the variables in Figure&nbsp;<a href="http://sfb649.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/fedc_homepage/xplore/tutorials/mvahtmlnode11.html#c1bhscafig">1.25</a>.
On the basis of the PCP and the scatterplot matrix
we would like to interpret each of the thirteen variables 
and their eventual relation to the 14th variable. 
Included in the figure are images
for <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg14.gif" alt="$X_1$">-<img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg12.gif" alt="$X_5$"> and  <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$">, although each

Taking the logarithm makes the variable's distribution more symmetric.
This can be seen in the boxplot of <!-- MATH

<img width="26" height="42" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg217.gif" alt="$\widetilde X_1$"> in Figure&nbsp;<a href="http://sfb649.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/fedc_homepage/xplore/tutorials/mvahtmlnode11.html#MVAboxbhd">1.27</a>

different mean values. However, taking a look at the scatterplots

Given that the scatterplot of <img width="65" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg219.gif" alt="$\log{(X_1)}$">

the two subgroups of <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg14.gif" alt="$X_1$"> correspond to houses with two different price levels. This
is confirmed by the two boxplots shown to the right of the <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg14.gif" alt="$X_1$"> vs. <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg13.gif" alt="$X_2$">

<p>
It strikes the eye in Figure&nbsp;<a href="http://sfb649.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/fedc_homepage/xplore/tutorials/mvahtmlnode11.html#c1bhscafig">1.25</a> that 
there is a large cluster of observations for which <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg13.gif" alt="$X_2$"> is equal to&nbsp;0. 
It also strikes the eye that--as the scatterplot of <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg14.gif" alt="$X_1$"> vs. <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg13.gif" alt="$X_2$"> shows--there 
is a strong, though non-linear, negative relation between <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg14.gif" alt="$X_1$"> and <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg13.gif" alt="$X_2$">: Almost all 
observations for which <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg13.gif" alt="$X_2$"> is high have an <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg14.gif" alt="$X_1$">-value close to zero, and 
vice versa, many observations for which <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg13.gif" alt="$X_2$"> is zero have  quite a 
high per-capita crime rate <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg14.gif" alt="$X_1$">. This
could be due to the location of the areas, e.g., downtown districts might have a higher
crime rate and at the same time it is unlikely that any residential land 
would be zoned in a generous manner.

</p><p>
As far as the house prices are concerned it can be said that there seems 
to be no clear (linear) relation between <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg13.gif" alt="$X_2$"> and <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$">, but it is obvious 
that the more expensive houses are situated in areas where <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg13.gif" alt="$X_2$"> is large 
(this can be seen from the two boxplots on the second position of the diagonal,
where the red one has a clearly higher mean/median than the black one).

Proportion of non-retail business acres <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg221.gif" alt="$X_3$"></a>
</h3>

<p>
The PCP (in Figure&nbsp;<a href="http://sfb649.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/fedc_homepage/xplore/tutorials/mvahtmlnode11.html#c1bhpcpfig">1.24</a>) as well as 
the scatterplot of <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg221.gif" alt="$X_3$"> vs. <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$"> shows an obvious negative relation 
between <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg221.gif" alt="$X_3$"> and <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$">. 
The relationship between the logarithms of both variables 
seems to be almost linear. This negative relation might be explained by the 
fact that non-retail business sometimes causes 
annoying sounds and other pollution. 
Therefore, it seems reasonable to use <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg221.gif" alt="$X_3$"> as an explanatory variable 
for the prediction of <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$"> in a linear-regression analysis.

</p><p>
As far as the distribution of <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg221.gif" alt="$X_3$"> is concerned it can be said that the kernel density 
estimate of <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg221.gif" alt="$X_3$"> clearly has two peaks, which indicates that there are two subgroups.
According to the negative relation between <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg221.gif" alt="$X_3$"> and <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$"> it could be the case that one 
subgroup corresponds to the more expensive houses and the other one to the cheaper houses.

</p><h3><a name="SECTION00383400000000000000">
Charles River dummy variable <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg11.gif" alt="$X_4$"></a>
</h3>

<p>
The observation made from the PCP that there are more expensive houses 
than cheap houses 
situated on the banks of the Charles River is confirmed by inspecting 
the scatterplot
matrix. Still, we might have some doubt that the proximity to the 
river influences the house prices. 
Looking at the original data set, it becomes 
clear that the observations for which <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg11.gif" alt="$X_4$"> equals one are districts 
that are close to  each other. Apparently, the Charles River 
does not flow through too many different 
districts. Thus, it may be pure coincidence that the more expensive districts are 
close to the Charles River--their high values might be caused by many other factors 
such as the pupil/teacher ratio or the proportion of non-retail business acres.

Nitric oxides concentration <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg12.gif" alt="$X_5$"></a>
</h3>

<p>
The scatterplot of <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg12.gif" alt="$X_5$"> vs. <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$"> and the separate boxplots of <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg12.gif" alt="$X_5$"> for more and less 
expensive houses reveal a clear negative relation between the two variables.
As it was the main aim of the authors of the original study to determine whether 
pollution had an influence on housing prices, it should be considered very carefully
whether <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg12.gif" alt="$X_5$"> can serve as an explanatory variable for the price <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$">. 
A possible reason against it being an explanatory variable is
that people might not like to live in areas where the emissions 
of nitric oxides are high. 
Nitric oxides are emitted mainly by automobiles, by factories and from 
heating private homes. However, as one can imagine there are 
many good reasons besides 
nitric oxides not to live downtown or in industrial areas! Noise pollution,
for example, 
might be a much better explanatory variable for the price of housing units. As the
emission of nitric oxides is usually accompanied by noise pollution, using <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg12.gif" alt="$X_5$"> as an 
explanatory variable for <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$"> might lead to the false conclusion that people run away 
from nitric oxides, whereas in reality it is noise pollution that they are 
trying to escape.

</h3>

<p>
The number of rooms per dwelling is a possible measure for the size 
of the houses. Thus we expect 
<img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg104.gif" alt="$X_6$"> to be strongly correlated with <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$"> (the houses' median price). Indeed--apart from 
some outliers--the scatterplot of <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg104.gif" alt="$X_6$"> vs. <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$"> shows a point cloud which is clearly 
upward-sloping and which seems to be a realisation of 
a linear dependence of <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$"> on <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg104.gif" alt="$X_6$">.
The two boxplots of <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg104.gif" alt="$X_6$"> confirm this notion by showing that the quartiles, the mean 
and the median are all much higher for the red than for the black boxplot.

<p>
There is no clear connection visible between <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg222.gif" alt="$X_7$"> and <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$">. There 
could be a weak negative correlation between the two variables, since 
the (red) boxplot of <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg222.gif" alt="$X_7$"> for
the districts whose price is above the median price indicates 
a lower mean and median than the (black) boxplot for the district 
whose price is below the median price. The 
fact that the correlation is not so clear could be explained by two 
opposing effects. On the one hand house prices should decrease if the older 
houses are not in a good shape. On the other hand prices could increase, 
because people often like older houses better than newer houses,
preferring their atmosphere of space and tradition. Nevertheless, 
it seems reasonable that the houses' age has an 
influence on their price <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$">.

</p><p>
Raising <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg222.gif" alt="$X_7$"> to the power of 2.5 reveals again that the data set might consist of two 
subgroups. But in this case it is not obvious that the subgroups correspond to more 
expensive or cheaper houses.
One can furthermore observe a negative relation between <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg222.gif" alt="$X_7$"> and <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg223.gif" alt="$X_8$">. 
This could 
reflect the way the Boston metropolitan area developed over time: 
the districts with the newer buildings are farther away from 
employment centres with industrial facilities.

Weighted distance to five Boston employment centres <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg223.gif" alt="$X_8$"></a>
</h3>

<p>
Since most people like to live close to their place of work, we expect a 
negative relation between the distances to the employment centres and the houses' price.
The scatterplot hardly reveals any dependence, but the boxplots of <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg223.gif" alt="$X_8$"> indicate that
there might be a slightly positive relation as the red boxplot's median and mean 
are higher than the black one's.
Again, there might be two effects in opposite directions at work. The first 
is that living too close to an employment centre might not provide 
enough shelter from the pollution created there. The second, 
as mentioned above, is that people do not travel very far 
to their workplace.

<p>
The first obvious thing one can observe in the scatterplots, 
as well in the histograms
and the kernel density estimates, 
is that there are two subgroups of districts containing 
<img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg211.gif" alt="$X_9$"> values which are close to the respective group's mean. The 
scatterplots deliver no hint as to 
what might explain the occurrence of these two subgroups. 
The boxplots indicate that for the cheaper and for the more expensive houses the 
average of <img width="26" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg211.gif" alt="$X_9$"> is almost the same.

<p>
The red and black boxplots of <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg209.gif" alt="$X_{11}$"> indicate a negative relation between <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg209.gif" alt="$X_{11}$"> and <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$">.

<p>
Interestingly, <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg208.gif" alt="$X_{12}$"> is negatively--though not linearly--correlated

whereas it is positively related with <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg7.gif" alt="$X_{14}$">.
Having a look at the data set reveals that for almost all districts <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg208.gif" alt="$X_{12}$"> takes on a
value around 390. Since <img width="19" height="15" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg225.gif" alt="$B$"> cannot be larger than 0.63, such values can only 
be caused by 
<img width="19" height="15" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg225.gif" alt="$B$"> close to zero. Therefore, the higher <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg208.gif" alt="$X_{12}$"> is, 
the lower the actual proportion
of blacks is! Among observations 
405 through 470 there are quite a few that have a  <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg208.gif" alt="$X_{12}$"> that is much 
lower than 390. This means that in these districts the proportion of blacks is above 
zero. 
We can observe two clusters of points in the scatterplots of <!-- MATH
 $\log{(X_{12})}$
 -->
<img width="72" height="34" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg227.gif" alt="$\log{(X_{12})}$">:
one cluster for 
which <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg208.gif" alt="$X_{12}$"> is close to 390 and a second one for which <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg208.gif" alt="$X_{12}$"> is between 3 and 100.
When <img width="33" height="32" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./1.8 Boston Housing_files/mvahtmlimg208.gif" alt="$X_{12}$"> is positively related with another variable, the actual proportion of 
blacks is negatively correlated with this variable and vice versa. This means that
blacks live in areas where there is a high proportion of non-retail business 
acres, where there are older houses and where there is a high (i.e., bad) 
pupil/teacher 
ratio. It can be observed that districts with housing prices above the 
median can only be found where the proportion of blacks is virtually zero!

4.3 Transformations</a>
</h2>

<p>
Since most of the variables exhibit an asymmetry 
with a higher density on the left side, 
the following transformations are proposed:
</p><p></p>
<div align="CENTER">
<!-- MATH
 \begin{eqnarray*}
\widetilde{X_1}  &=&  \log{(X_1)}\\
\widetilde{X_2}  &=&  X_2/10\\

\widetilde{X_4}  & & \textrm{none, since }X_4\textrm{ is binary}\\
\widetilde{X_5}  &=&  \log{(X_5)}\\
\widetilde{X_6}  &=&  \log{(X_6)}\\

\widetilde{X_{10}} &=&  \log{(X_{10})}\\
\widetilde{X_{11}} &=&  \exp{(0.4 \times X_{11})}/1000\\
\widetilde{X_{12}} &=&  X_{12}/100\\
\widetilde{X_{13}} &=&  \sqrt{X_{13}}\\

\end{eqnarray*}">
<br clear="ALL"></div><p></p>
<br clear="ALL"><p></p>
<br clear="ALL"><p></p>
Taking 
the logarithm or raising the variables to the power of something smaller than one helps to reduce
the asymmetry. This is due to the fact that lower values move further away from each 
other, whereas the distance between greater values is reduced by these transformations.
